# Triboelectric-Force-Feedback-Interface
Very simple project that can allow for a liquid-metal based elastomer to act as a force transducer. This project converts triboelectric signals into a converted value that is interpreted as force. 

No firmware is done for this so far, just hardware, and NON-optimised at that.
